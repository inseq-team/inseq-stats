## Advanced reporting for Inseq

This private repository is used to collect traffic statistics for the [`inseq-team/inseq`](https://github.com/inseq-team/inseq) repository by means of the [`jgehrcke/github-repo-stats`](https://github.com/jgehrcke/github-repo-stats) Github Action, overcoming the 14-day traffic data retention limit of Github.

Reports in different formats (pdf, html, csv) are generated daily and pushed in the dedicated `github-repo-stats` branch of this repository.
